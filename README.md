# Investigating constraint universality using large cross­linguistic corpora

# Abstract
How can we tell whether human language is subject to a particular phonetic or
cognitive bias? We build on Frisch et al. (2004) and the new XPF Corpus and
show that phonetic and cognitive biases should manifest in cross­linguistic
examination of lexicons of unrelated lan­guages. In two corpus studies we show that
final­ devoicing, a strong and well established bias, manifests as a soft constraint
in the lexicons of most languages, and that fricative manner harmony manifests
as a soft constraint above chance. Our methodology, which complements existing
approaches, allows researchers to easily verify whether a particular language­
specific pattern applies universally or not.
Keywords: soft constraints, lexicons, phonetic biases, corpora, XPF Corpus,
final devoicing, man­ner harmony
